    <H2>it wasnt a little girl..</H2>
    <p>
        I was camping with my husband and his family at a small,
         remote lake in New Mexico. There were about 10 people in our group and another group of six people in the next campsite.
          It was nighttime and both groups were doing typical activities:
           making s’mores, having a few drinks and telling stories, when we all heard what sounded like a little girl yelling out for help.
            Neither group had children with them, but we were all positive we were hearing a little girl and decided to search the area we heard the noises from together.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was a field behind our campsites, and we all saw a very tall, pure white figure standing maybe 100ft away from us in the field,
             making the noises. We all agreed this thing looked maybe 6 feet tall, skinny, and white as can be. We made our way closer to investigate, but whatever it was that we saw started backing off as we got closer, and it disappeared into the trees.
              All night we continued to hear a little girl calling for help as we tried to sleep.

        The walking dead
    </H2>
    <p>
        I'm a psychiatric nurse and early in my career, I worked at a residential mental health facility.
         One of our residents was an elective mute, which means that he didn't/wouldn't/couldn't talk, but there were no medical reasons as to why.
          He had spoken earlier in his life and in fact seemed quite normal back then, with the exception of being close to seven feet tall.
           He'd been raised in the Deep South and joined the military when he was 19, but one night he vanished.
            He was declared AWOL, and eventually he was declared missing and dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ten years later, a seven-foot tall man walked into a VA Hospital emergency room in my part of the Midwest and said to the receptionist:
         "My name is Marion Duchene (not the real name), and I've been dead for ten years."
        Those were the last words he ever spoke.
        He was covered with dust, and he was wearing the same clothes he'd been reported to be wearing the night he vanished.
         His social security number had not been used and he had no identification on his person. However, they were able to identify him, I guess via fingerprints.
          The family was notified but they said they had already grieved their lost man and that whomever was claiming to be him simply could not be.
           They demanded not to be contacted again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marion paced all day every day, moving his mouth that looked like talking or muttering, but no sound came out.
         He had an unnerving habit of throwing his head back with his mouth wide open as if he were laughing heartily, but not even a breath could be heard.
          If I talked to him, he appeared to listen, periodically throwing his head back in that laughter-mimicking way of his.
        Various medications were tried, but they did not affect him either positively or negatively.
         Occupational therapy did nothing because Marion would just grin and unless told to stay put, he'd get up and start pacing again.
    </p>
    <p>
        On my last day at that job, the last thing I saw was Marion, pacing in the parking lot, throwing his head back to "laugh."
         Later I wondered if all along I'd been dealing with a ghost. All these years later, I still don't know.

        Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
    </H2>
    <p>
        After we moved into our home, we were told a woman had died there at the hands of her abusive husband.
         She hated men. My dad would wake up with scratches all over himself,
          and whenever my brother was mean to my sister or I, he would have scratches on him as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        One day, my brother hurt our sister he hit her with something. When he woke up later that night he had a horrible bloody nose.
        he day we moved out, my brother accidentally broke his twin’s arm trying out a wrestling move.
    </p>
    <p>
        He swears that he would have died that night if it wasn't our last in the house.

        It was good to see an old friend..)
    </H2>
    <p>
        When I was 37, I went to my high school reunion.
         I flew into the nearest airport and rented a car. 
         The distance was about 35 miles through a very rural and almost abandoned part of the country.
          About three miles outside of town I see someone on the side of the road, flagging me down.
           It turned out that it was one of the guys I had attended school with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jim (not his name) gets in the car and we start talking. I had not seen him in twenty years, but he still looked the same, maybe a little older.
        We get to town and I ask him if he wants to come to the VFW and have a drink. He says "No, just take me home."
    </p>
    <p>
        Jim's parents had lived only a few blocks from my grandmother’s house, and I turned in that direction but he said to take him to the outskirts of town.
               There was a mobile home park out there, and I figured that is where he lived. When we reached the end of the turn off he said, "Just drop me here.
                It was good to see you again" and he walks off into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
        I go to the VFW, met some of my old classmates, we start to talk. As we are talking about who is coming to the reunion, I mention that I had just picked Jim up three miles east of town and had dropped him off. 
                            Everyone gets quiet; even the guy singing karaoke stops and lays down the mike. 
                                My cousin goes white as a new t-shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Barb, Jim died on that curve eight years ago. Rolled his car. We were all at his funeral," I was told.
                                         I started to feel really dizzy, and I went out to the car to take some deep breaths.
                                          There on the seat is the local newspaper, printed eight years previous, containing Jim's obituary. I still have the paper.

        The Smiling Man
    </H2>
    <p>
        About five years ago I lived downtown in a major city in the US. 
        I've always been a night person, so I would often find myself bored after my roommate, who was decidedly not a night person, went to sleep.
         To pass the time, I used to go for long walks and spend the time thinking.
I spent four years like that, walking alone at night, and never once had a reason to feel afraid.
 I always used to joke with my roommate that even the drug dealers in the city were polite.
  But all of that changed in just a few minutes of one evening.
    <p>
        It was a Wednesday, somewhere between one and two in the morning, and I was walking near a police patrolled park quite a ways from my apartment.
 It was a quiet night, even for a week night, with very little traffic and almost no one on foot.
  The park, as it was most nights, was completely empty.
I turned down a short side street in order to loop back to my apartment when I first noticed him.
 At the far end of the street, on my side, was the silhouette of a man, dancing. It was a strange dance, similar to a waltz, but he finished each "box" with an odd forward stride.
  I guess you could say he was dance-walking, headed straight for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deciding he was probably drunk, I stepped as close as I could to the road to give him the majority of the sidewalk to pass me by.
 The closer he got, the more I realized how gracefully he was moving.
  He was very tall and lanky, and wearing an old suit. He danced closer still, until I could make out his face.
   His eyes were open wide and wild, head tilted back slightly, looking off at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
        His mouth was formed in a painfully wide cartoon of a smile. Between the eyes and the smile, I decided to cross the street before he danced any closer.
I took my eyes off of him to cross the empty street. As I reached the other side, I glanced back... and then stopped dead in my tracks. He had stopped dancing and was standing with one foot in the street, perfectly parallel to me. He was facing me but still looking skyward. Smile still wide on his lips.
I was completely and utterly unnerved by this. I started walking again, but kept my eyes on the man. He didn't move.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I had put about half a block between us, I turned away from him for a moment to watch the sidewalk in front of me. The street and sidewalk ahead of me were completely empty. Still unnerved, I looked back to where he had been standing to find him gone. For the briefest of moments I felt relieved, until I noticed him. He had crossed the street, and was now slightly crouched down. I couldn't tell for sure due to the distance and the shadows, but I was certain he was facing me. I had looked away from him for no more than 10 seconds, so it was clear that he had moved fast.
I was so shocked that I stood there for some time, staring at him. And then he started moving toward me again. He took giant, exaggerated tip toed steps, as if he were a cartoon character sneaking up on someone. Except he was moving very, very quickly.
I'd like to say at this point I ran away or pulled out my pepper spray or my cellphone or anything at all, but I didn't. I just stood there, completely frozen as the smiling man crept toward me.
And then he stopped again, about a car length away from me. Still smiling his smile, still looking to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I finally found my voice, I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. What I meant to ask was, "What the fuck do you want?!" in an angry, commanding tone. What came out was a whimper, "What the fuu…?"
Regardless of whether or not humans can smell fear, they can certainly hear it. I heard it in my own voice, and that only made me more afraid. But he didn't react to it at all. He just stood there, smiling.
And then, after what felt like forever, he turned around, very slowly, and started dance-walking away. Just like that. Not wanting to turn my back to him again, I just watched him go, until he was far enough away to almost be out of sight. And then I realized something. He wasn't moving away anymore, nor was he dancing. I watched in horror as the distant shape of him grew larger and larger. He was coming back my way. And this time he was running.
I ran too.
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran until I was off of the side road and back onto a better lit road with sparse traffic. Looking behind me then, he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the way home, I kept glancing over my shoulder, always expecting to see his stupid smile, but he was never there.
I lived in that city for six months after that night, and I never went out for another walk. There was something about his face that always haunted me. He didn't look drunk, he didn't look high. He looked completely and utterly insane. And that's a very, very scary thing to see.

        Horrible Halloween Night
    </H2>
    <p>
        Me and a friend were invited to a house party just for college students in the richer area of the town, so the house was huge with an anchor of land and pool area.
         This party was themed to be a little naughty, so my friend dressed in a sexy nurse outfit, and I dressed as a belly dancer.
          Majority of the party took place in the house as there was maybe like 70 people with the house being very spacious, so not too difficult to get around.
           I’m not much of a drinker, but I did have some juice that was available. Some friends pulled me and my friend and over to take some pics and I set my drink down.
After what felt like an hour of just taking pictures, I found my cup and took another sip, not even worrying that I left my cup alone for a while.
 Then a man came up to me who looked to be in his late 20s, early 30s.
    </p>
    <p>
        He said my boyfriend’s name and said he’s been trying to call me. That’s when I realized I didn’t have my phone on me.
   I have loads of respect for my boyfriend, we always make sure to stay in contact with each other, and since he had to work, I promised I would contact him, but I just forgotten.
The man said it’s urgent and said I can use his phone to call in one of the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        So not thinking at all, I followed the man, if my boyfriend really wanted to call me, then I knew it would be something terrible.
  As we entered the room, I felt as if I just ran a mile and felt winded.
   The man closed the door behind me and sat me on the bed and gave me his phone.
    I started to feel more weak, like I just got a migraine and just couldn’t call. Then I was helped to lay down and within seconds, I was out cold.
I woke up later, not sure where I was or what even happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found my friend rubbing a napkin on my tummy while yelling.
  It took me a bit to come back to reality and I realized I was in a bedroom with my friend cleaning some stuff off of me.
   That’s when I had a panic attack and just realized that I quite possibly have been used. 
   My friend calmed me down and told me that didn’t happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        She explained that she couldn’t find me anywhere and assumed I went to the bathroom.
 But after like some minutes, I still didn’t show.
    </p>
    <p>
        So she went looking for me, eventually checking the bedrooms and found me laying in bed with the guy something out of my belly button.
        Apparently he was playing shots with my unconscious body of of sucking alcohol out of my belly button, licking salt from my chest, and kissing my lips.
         She didn’t know how long this went on for, but I immediately felt sick and even coughed up from just the thought.
     Thankfully my boyfriend got off of work early after my friend told him what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
        He picked me up while my friend asked around about the guy, but of course, no one who of him or recognized him.
        I was taken to urgent care and looked at, thankfully nothing was wrong with me and the drug in my drink didn’t cause any further harm then just knocking me out.
        I wish the story ends here, but I started to receive texts from a random guy, at first he was just asking me random things and I just didn’t reply, 
        but then he showed me a pic of my torso and started saying creepy things to me and even giving me the impression he’s stalking me. This is still going on today, just texting me randomly.
         I’ve had the idea to try to bait him one of these days to finally have backup to catch him, but I don’t know how smart he can be and what he will do to me if things don’t go as planned.

        The demon’s room
    </H2>
    <p>
        I worked as a forensic nurse in a hospital’s lock-up unit.
         We had one older lady who swore she was being haunted and abused by a demon she would call Tiberius.
          So many crazy things happened while she was on the unit. We’d go into the room, do normal care, leave, and seconds later she’d start screaming bloody murder.
           We’d run into the room to find her looking like she’d been in a fight with a boxing champ—bloody lip, black eye, markings all over her body.
            No one ever saw her doing this stuff to herself. Things would get moved around the room by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        At one point she was in protective restraints because the doctor thought she was hurting herself. 
             There was no way she could have moved or done anything to herself while in these restraints, but new marks would always appear or her tray/cart would be across the room.
              The room was secure so there was no way someone else was doing this.
               When we asked her questions, she’d just say, “It was Tiberius.”
    </p>
    <p>
        After she was discharged, we always had trouble with that room.
 If there was going to be a rapid response or code, it happened in that room.
  One night a guard reported lights blinking on and off.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was that room.
